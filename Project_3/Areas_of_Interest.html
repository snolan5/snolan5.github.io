    <div class="card-body">
      <p class="card-text">Computational neuroscience is a branch of neuroscience which uses computational approaches to study the nervous system. The computational neuroscience discipline roughly divides into two subfields. A first, which may be called theoretical neuroscience focuses on principled approaches towards arriving at meaningful models of the nervous system. This field contains many aspects of mathematical neuroscience  which employs mathematical techniques to arrive at models. Models in theoretical neuroscience are often aimed at capturing the essential features of the biological system at multiple spatial-temporal scales, from membrane currents, and chemical coupling via network oscillations, columnar and topographic architecture, all the way up to behavior. These computational models frame hypotheses that can often be directly tested by biological or psychological experiments. A second subfield, which is often called neural data science focuses on approaches towards making sense of the progressively larger datasets in neuroscience. This may include the processing of electrophysiological or imaging data, the fitting of models to data, and the comparison of models. These two subfields are highly synergistic and many papers draw from both traditions

    <h5 class="card-header">Data Mining</h5>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p class="card-text">Data mining is the process of discovering patterns in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of machine learning, statistics, and database systems. Data mining is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and statistics with an overall goal to extract information (with intelligent methods) from a data set and transform the information into a comprehensible structure for further use. Data mining is the analysis step of the "knowledge discovery in databases" process or KDD. Aside from the raw analysis step, it also involves database and data management aspects, data pre-processing, model and inference considerations, interestingness metrics, complexity considerations, post-processing of discovered structures, visualization, and online updating.
The term "data mining" is a misnomer, because the goal is the extraction of patterns and knowledge from large amounts of data, not the extraction (mining) of data itself.

    <h5 class="card-header">Machine Learning</h5>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p class="card-text">Machine learning (ML) is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead. It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task. Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as email filtering and computer vision, where it is difficult or infeasible to develop a conventional algorithm for effectively performing the task.

    <h5 class="card-header">Artificial Intelligence</h5>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p class="card-text">In computer science, artificial intelligence (AI), sometimes called machine intelligence, is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans. Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals. Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is often used to describe machines (or computers) that mimic "cognitive" functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as "learning" and "problem solving".</p>
